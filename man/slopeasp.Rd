\title{
	Calculate slope and aspect from elevation data.
}
\description{
	Uses gridded elevation data to calculate slope and aspect, by default using a 3x3 region. The horizontal resolution and vertical resolution must be in the same units.
}
\usage{
slopeasp(x, EWres, NSres, EWkernel, NSkernel, smoothing=1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
	gridded elevation data, either as a SpatialGridDataFrame, dataframe, or matrix.
}
  \item{EWres}{
	East-West grid resolution. May be omitted if x is a SpatialGridDataFrame and the horizontal units are the same as the vertical units.
}
  \item{NSres}{
	North-South grid resolution. May be omitted if x is a SpatialGridDataFrame and the horizontal units are the same as the vertical units.
}
  \item{EWkernel}{
	The kernel to use when calculating the East-West component of slope. If missing, a 3x3 kernel will be used.
}
  \item{NSkernel}{
	The kernel to use when calculating the North-South component of slope. If missing, a 3x3 kernel will be used.
}
  \item{smoothing}{
	A positive integer describing the additional smoothing to be applied, if any. smoothing=1 (default) means no smoothing will be used.
}
}
\details{
	By default, a 3x3 Sobel filter is used (as is standard in many GIS packages). A larger Sobel filter or a different filter will give varying results. This filter provides the third-order finite difference weighted by reciprocal of distance method proposed by Unwin (1981).

\value{
	\item{slope }{The slope of the DEM, in degrees}
	\item{aspect }{The aspect of the DEM, beginning with north and moving clockwise, and with aspect = 0 where slope = 0.}
